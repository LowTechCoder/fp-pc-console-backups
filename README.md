# linux-os-backups

This is a reminder of how I plan on backing up and recovering an entire Linux system.

Backup locations:
spinning giant HD
25gb Blu-ray

Tools to use:
sudo dd status=progress bs=64k if=/dev/sdSRC of=/dev/sdDEST

Computers:
NUC i5
NUC i7
AMD big computer with 6600 vid card

I can for sure get the same backup from the Intel NUC's, but it may be possible to even have the same for my AMD machine as well.  But I'll probably just do separate backups for the 2 different kinds of computers, just to be on the safe side.
